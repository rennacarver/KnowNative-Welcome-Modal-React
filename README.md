- Allows selection of starter text

## How It's Made

React, CSS

## Lessons Learned/Future Enhancements

- It's faster to develop prototypes within the destination framework
- Styling radio buttons requires a fair amount of CSS trial and error
- Modal dialogs should use a single dialog element to enable CSS transitions
- CSS transitions don't work with max-height properties and auto values
